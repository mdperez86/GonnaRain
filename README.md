# GonnaRain iOS APP

This is a Weather iOS APP powered by [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

## Local testing

Make sure your `WEATHER_API` and `WEATHER_API_KEY` environment variables are well configured in XCode `Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme...` then `Run -> Arguments -> Environment Variables`

## For production

This APP uses [Swift GYB](https://nshipster.com/swift-gyb/) to obfuscate your Environment Variables based on the following article [Secret Management on iOS](https://nshipster.com/secrets/)
